# MikanOS

This repository aims to be a record of the progress made during the reading of the book [ゼロからのOS自作入門]"Arm an OS from zero, introduction" from 内田公太　(Uchida Kouta). There will be constant updates on the progress made when creating the Mikan operating system. The files made during the exercises will be uploaded and a brief description of what was done in each update will be written. Also, since the book is in Japanese the progress in reading the book may take time as it requires translation work on my part. I strongly recommend that if you know Japanese, you buy the book.
